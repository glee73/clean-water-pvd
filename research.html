                    <p> <strong>Cost.</strong> The budget approval process
                      for Providence's main water utility, Providence Water,
                      involves three governing bodies: Providence Water itself,
                      the Public Utilities Commission, and the city council.
                      Increasing water rates is the easiest way to fund total
                      lead line replacement, but for that to happen, all three
                      bodies must all agree to do so. </p>
                    <p> <strong>Implementation.</strong> Hiring contractors
                      to replace public lead lines is difficult due to shortage
                      of labor available to execute such a large-scale
                      infrastructure project.  </p>
                    <p>  <strong>Community Buy-In.</strong> Total lead line
                      replacement will also require homeowners and landlords to
                      replace their own lead pipes, which can be politically
                      unpopular and difficult to mandate.  </p>

                    <p>Providence Water introduced a zero-interest loan program
                      in May 2018. The loan program allows homeowners to pay no
                      interest for up to 3 years on a loan of about $3,000,
                      which covers the cost of replacing their side of the line.
                      As of March 2019, 68 private lines had been replaced
                      through the loan program, with 200 additional households
                      throughout Providence, Cranston, Johnston, and Smithfield
                      on the waiting list.</p>

                          lead levels within water at Madison were considered to
                          be over the new limit of 15ppb. </li> </p>

                            contractors ensured maximum efficiency when

                          <p> <li> Two primary sources of funding for public
                            replacements: The city council approved placing
                            half the cost of customer lead service lines on
                            sewer rates, which were not regulated by  the PSC.

                          <p> <li> Water Utility Quality Manager Joe Grande says,
                            “We are light years ahead of other utilities that
                            have decided to do the corrosion control chemicals,
                            which they’ll do forever until they do replace the
                            lead services.” Lead in drinking water is no longer
