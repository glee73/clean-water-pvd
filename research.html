                    <p> <strong>Cost.</strong> The budget approval process
                      for Providence's main water utility, Providence Water,
                      involves three governing bodies: Providence Water itself,
                      the Public Utilities Commission, and the city council.
                      Increasing water rates is the easiest way to fund total
                      lead line replacement, but for that to happen, all three
                      bodies must all agree to do so. </p>
                    <p> <strong>Implementation.</strong> Hiring contractors
                      to replace public lead lines is difficult due to shortage
                      of labor available to execute such a large-scale
                      infrastructure project.  </p>
                    <p>  <strong>Community Buy-In.</strong> Total lead line
                      replacement will also require homeowners and landlords to
                      replace their own lead pipes, which can be politically
                      unpopular and difficult to mandate.  </p>

                    <p>Providence Water introduced a zero-interest loan program
                      in May 2018. The loan program allows homeowners to pay no
                      interest for up to 3 years on a loan of about $3,000,
                      which covers the cost of replacing their side of the line.
                      As of March 2019, 68 private lines had been replaced
                      through the loan program, with 200 additional households
                      throughout Providence, Cranston, Johnston, and Smithfield
                      on the waiting list.</p>

                            sewer rates, which were not regulated by  the PSC.

                            have decided to do the corrosion control chemicals,

                <div class="research-content-text">
                  There are a number of potential solutions to improving the lead pipe situation in Providence. First, the Public Utilities Commission should work with the Water Utility to prioritize lead pipe replacements. These entities should word with legislative bodies to allow for public dollars to be used for private replacements in order to fully eliminate lead lines. Additionally, local government can ensure the whole lead line is eliminated by passing a mandate requiring all private residents to replace their lead pipes. PW has diligently worked to apply for, and receive, federal grants that will also fund these initiatives, and should continue to seek federal funding for lead line replacements. Individual residents can lobby for this prioritization by contacting their city council representatives or the PUC directly.
