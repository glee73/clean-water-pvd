domain no longer exists! 

but here's a [figma prototype](https://tinyurl.com/clean-water-pvd-figma) of what the website looked like.

and here's a [compilation](https://tinyurl.com/clean-water-pvd) representing our work containing:

1. a policy brief and case study of lead service line replacement (lslr) in pittsburgh, madison, and north providence
2. a case study of lslr in newark
3. a statistical analysis of providence water's loan program participation; variables of particular interest are geographic location and socioeconomic status
4. white paper explaining the complexities of lslr implementation
