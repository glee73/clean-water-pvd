        <p class="sub-header"> Why are lead pipes dangerous? </p>
        <p class="lead-blurb" style=" width: 80%;font-size: 1.05em; margin-left: 20px;">
            According to the CDC, both short-term and long-term overexposure
            to lead can cause severe, life-threatening symptoms. These include neurological symptoms such as depression, forgetfulness, and memory loss. Lead can also cause organ damage, leading to heart or kidney disease. Additionally, lead overexposure may cause miscarriages and stillbirths in pregnant women, and at low levels of exposure, long-term neurological damage to the child.

        <button class="accordion">Should I test my water for lead?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Yes, we recommend that all homeowners and renters living in the Providence area test their water for lead. Lead is a harmful metal, and if consumed in drinking water, could have detrimental long-term physical and psychological consequences for one’s health.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How do I find out whether there is lead in my water?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>There are two steps in the process of checking whether your water may be exposing you to lead.</p>
        <p>First, you can assess whether your house is suspected to have lead lines using Providence Water’s map of suspected lead lines. This method is NOT definitive and should be used in tandem with a lead testing kit. </p>
        <p>Second, you may order a free lead testing kit from Providence Water during business hours at (401) 521-6303 or <em><a class="hyperlink" href="https://provwater.com/water_quality/lead-center/testkits"> here </a></em>. Note that it may take in excess of a month to receive your results, unless you contact a private lab. In the meantime, you should take standard precautions. </p>

        <button class="accordion">How do I go about replacing my lead lines?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p><strong> Full-cost replacement </strong>: Providence Water’s Water “Main Rehabilitation Program” is conducting large-scale water main replacement to eradicate lead and modernize the city’s water mains. This program will NOT replace lead service lines, which are privately owned connections between the public water mains and homes. During construction, however, homeowners have the option to request that Providence Water’s contractor replace the lead service connection from the meter to the curb. To facilitate replacement, Providence Water will provide a no-cost estimate for the repair.</p>

        <p><strong>Loan program</strong>: Providence Water offers a 10-year, 0% interest loan of up to $4,500 to cover the cost of lead-line replacement. Providence Water will cover all costs in excess of $4,500. To request a loan, as well as a replacement, call (401) 521-6303. As there are limited funds available, there may be a waiting period. Requests are granted on a first-come, first-served basis. For more information, visit Providence Water’s Loan Program website here.</p>

        <button class="accordion">If I cannot afford to fix my lead lines, what should I do in the meantime?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Whenever your water has not been used for several hours, flush water from a kitchen or bathroom faucet for at least 3-5 minutes. You will use only a few gallons of water to do this and the cost will be just over a penny. You can also save the flushed water for watering houseplants or gardens or for cleaning purposes. Do this process whenever your water has not been used for several hours; for example, when you wake up and when you return home from work or school.</p>

        <p>Use COLD water for cooking and preparing baby formula. Do NOT cook with or drink water from the hot water tap; lead dissolves more easily into hot water. Do not use water from the hot water tap to make baby formula.</p>

        <p>Obtain a water filtration system, which are widely available at most home-goods or department stores. Purchase only filters that pass NSF's testing criteria and bare the NSF mark to ensure that water will be adequately filtered. Leaving a filter in for longer than its recommended life can actually cause levels of lead or other contaminants to increase because of accumulation in the filter.</p>

        <p>You can find additional information on managing lead contaminated water at the Environmental Protection Agency’s website here.</p>

        <button class="accordion">What is Providence Water?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Providence Water (PW) is a semi-public water utility that provides all drinking water for the City of Providence, as well as surrounding areas. It is regulated by city ordinances, the Rhode Island Department of Health, as well as the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. Its rate structure is regulated by the Rhode Island Public Utilities Commission.</p>

        <button class="accordion">How has the city of Providence responded to the lead issue so far?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>The city of Providence has yet to develop and execute a full-scale plan for lead eradication in the water system. Currently, Providence Water is conducting its Water Main Rehabilitation Program to replace all of the city’s water mains with new piping that does not include lead. However, this replacement does not include service lines, which connect homes to water mains and may still contaminate drinking water with lead. Furthermore, Providence Water is offering a 10 year, 0% interest loan program to own homeowners with the cost of lead-line replacement.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What are lead service lines and how do they compare to water mains?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Service lines are privately owned connections between one’s home and the public water mains. Unlike water mains, which are large pipes that run down all city streets, service lines are owned by the homeowner and run from the curb to the meter. Many service lines in Providence are constructed from lead, and consequently have the potential to contaminate drinking water. While the city is replacing all water mains, they have not yet developed a plan to replace all lead service lines at no cost to the homeowner.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What have other cities done to respond to hazardous levels of lead?</button>
        <div class="panel">
        <p>Numerous other cities have conducted full scale lead piping replacements at no cost to the homeowner. For example, the city of Newark is actively replacing all of the city’s water mains, as well as the privately owned lines connecting to homes.</p>
